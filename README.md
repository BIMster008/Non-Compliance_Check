A Py Script to check the "Garbage" of the IFC Schema

Did you ever get bothered by too much and unnecessary information in the IFC schema?
Did you ever get annoyed by those repeating properties in serveral Psets?

I do :)
Therefore, I have created this python script, which you can execute in BonsaiBIM to check your IFC schema.
All you need is the IFC file that is going to be checked against an IDS. The definitions of the IDS will be the limits, which the IFC should be comprised of.

Since I have generated this first Python script with the help of ChatGPT 4o, I would appreciate any valuable hints and tricks to improve this checking.
